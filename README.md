# GodOfHunger

God of Hunger is the name of the videogame I am currently developing for Oculus Quest as my master thesis project. The goal of my thesis is to study the concept of Flow applied to Virtual Reality videogames, in particular, since a higher level of immersion can foster the reaching of a Flow state, two versions of the same game will be developed comparing the immersion brought by two interaction modes: Oculus Hand Tracking and Oculus Controllers.

The player will embody a powerful God that, with their divine powers, will help a faithful cultist to overcome a dangerous dungeon filled with enemies made of subsequent rooms and ending with a powerful boss. The game structure is similar to the Roguelite one, letting the player choose different power-ups after each completed room.
To strengthen the probabilities for a player to reach the Flow state, the game features an Active Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment by letting the player decide the type and number of enemies that will invade the next room they will face. The difficulty of the final boss is proportional to the difficulty of previous challenges.
